## Coach Hamza's Core Philosophy (from the book)
1. **Preparation is everything** — Hydration prep starts weeks before Ramadan. Have an accountability partner. Set clear goals.
2. **The 5 Pillars are non-negotiable** — Shahadah, Salah, Zakah, Sawm, Hajj. Faith comes first, performance follows.
3. **Nutrition is recovery** — Sahoor focuses on slow-release energy (dates, fruits, complex carbs). Iftar starts with dates and water, hydrating foods first, then balanced plate (35% vegetables, 35% protein, 30% carbs). Post-Taraweeh protein shake for recovery.
4. **Training adapts, not stops** — Reduce intensity, not frequency. Time training relative to Iftar. Listen to your body. Urine color is your hydration gauge.
5. **Sleep is sacred** — Aim for 6-8 hours. Naps are recommended. Rest = performance.
6. **Mental health matters** — Don't compare your Ramadan to others. Take breaks from social media. It's okay to not fast if you're unwell.
7. **Community strengthens you** — Invite non-Muslim friends to Iftar. Volunteer. Smile. The community challenges make Ramadan richer.
8. **Transition beyond Ramadan** — The 5-step transition: Dua, Pillars, Quran, Distance from sin, Forgiveness.
