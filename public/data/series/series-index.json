      "description": "A jewel-encrusted crown for a verse recited. Chalets of crystal sparkling on the horizon for a soul that gave up sins. Tree trunks of green emerald and branches of gold for a dhikr oft-repeated. Each of your shuddering breaths, every second of discomfort you faced, and every one of your sacrifices—all have been accounted for, returned manifold with sights and rewards unimaginable. \n\nIt was Al-Musawwir, the Most Beautiful Fashioner of Form—Beauty Himself—who fashioned your eternal sanctuary. Built by your deeds and decorated by your du’as, your home awaits. \nEnter into Jannah, O weary soul, and rest, for the One who you lived for is eternally pleased with you.\n\nThis Ramadan, travel to Jannah with Dr. Omar Suleiman and learn how to lavish your eternal home with du’as, deeds, and dedications.",
